    " * \"we can capture information about the meanings of words by measuring **how they go together in texts**\"\n",

The first two steps are useful in their own right; you can do a lot of productive analysis even if you stop at either. The last is really more of preparatory step for Friday. But all three help us see how we can quantify the theoretical ideas expressed above."

In that case, \"rightful\" would be a collocate of \"uniting\" in *Pride and Prejudice*, even though the former never appears again after the first two sentences, and the latter never appears until the last sentence!\n",

    "Since we already have a way to find KWICs, we'll use it as a step in finding collocates. But it's worth noting that you don't *have* to go through KWICs to get to collocates. You're always collecting collocates from the window surrounding a word, but you don't necessarily need to record all of the relevant contexts—it's fine to skip straight to the counts, if that's all you want."
