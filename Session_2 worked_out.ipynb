    " * \"we can capture information about the meanings of words by measuring **how they go together in texts**\"\n",

The first two steps are useful in their own right; you can do a lot of productive analysis even if you stop at either. The last is really more of preparatory step for Friday. But all three help us see how we can quantify the theoretical ideas expressed above."

    "The **collocates** of a term are the words that appear near it in some corpus. That is, they're the words that \"co-located\" with the term. Yet another way to put it is that for any target term, its collocates are all of the words in its KWICs. For instance, looking at the KWICs for \"truth\" in our passage with window size 3:\n",

We'd get a very different table with a window of 10 or 100 words, and in some applications people even zoom out to the document level. In that case, \"rightful\" would be a collocate of \"uniting\" in *Pride and Prejudice*, even though the former never appears again after the first two sentences, and the latter never appears until the last sentence!\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have a way to find KWICs, we'll use it as a step in finding collocates. But it's worth noting that you don't *have* to go through KWICs to get to collocates. You're always collecting collocates from the window surrounding a word, but you don't necessarily need to record all of the relevant contexts—it's fine to skip straight to the counts, if that's all you want."

The arrangement consists of a series of **vectors**, which, as we learned on Monday, are just lists of numbers. Calculating relationships between words is much easier when we use vectors. We'll get into the details about distance on Friday, but producing the table or vector structure is an important first step."
